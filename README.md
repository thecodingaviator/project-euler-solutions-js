# project-euler-solutions-js
Heyo! Welcome to my repo containing Project Euler code solutions. :high-five:
They're all written in JavaScript and silly me 🤦‍♂️ sometimes forgets to remove the `console.log()`s and `console.clear()`s after I'm done, so keep on the lookout for that!

Try to solve the challenges yourself before peeking 👀 over here and have an awesome day!
