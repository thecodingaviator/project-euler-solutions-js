# project-euler-solutions-js
### Heyo! Welcome to my repo containing Project Euler code solutions. :high-five:
They're all written in JavaScript and silly me ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è sometimes forgets to remove the `console.log()`s and `console.clear()`s after I'm done, so keep on the lookout for that! My freeCodeCamp account (where you can see how I progressed through these challenges) is [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/hiparthparth). If a solution (for problems <20) is missing, it's because this repo started way after I started those challenges, I'll add them sometime (or not ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø).

Try to solve the challenges yourself before peeking üëÄ over here and have an awesome day!

Oh, also. Yes, I know that when using nested loops, declaring the control variables outside the loops is like infinitely more efficient. I just like doing them like this.
